### rainbow-video: examples

The aesthetic appeal of the image mosaic really depends on the range and intensity of colours in the input video.  
Many films don't have a hugely varied palette, so the rainbow effect in the output is weak or vague.

Here are some examples of films that had a pleasing result:

_Der Student von Prag_ (Stellan Rye & Paul Wegener, DE 1913):

_Purple Rain_ (Albert Magnoli, US 1984):

_Sedmikrásky_ aka _Daisies_ (Věra Chytilová, CZ 1966):

The script can also be used for black-and-white films.

_Les yeux sans visage_ aka _Eyes without a Face_ (Georges Franju, FR 1960):
